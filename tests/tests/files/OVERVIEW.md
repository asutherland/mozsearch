Here are some interesting symbols:
- `GlobalContext`
- `GlobalContext::decideBooleanTrait()`
  - and here it is without parens: `GlobalContext::decideBooleanTrait`
  - and with stuff between the parens: `GlobalContext::decideBooleanTrait(...)`

Here's some just normal bullet points with things that aren't symbols:
- `not_a_symbol_we_have`
  - `not_an_id_we_have_is_probably_more_accurate`
- `not really a legal symbol at all I think`
